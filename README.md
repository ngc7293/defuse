# Defuse

Defuse is a small command-line executable to "help" resolve [_Keep Talking and
Nobody Explodes_](https://keeptalkinggame.com/) bomb modules. There are probably many like it, but this one is mine.

*Is this cheating?*

I don't think so. I you think so just don't use it I guess. I especially don't
consider it cheating for personal use because it is a product of my own
cognitive work, but I also like sharing code so yeah.

*Is this copyright infringement?*

I assume not since it is based on the publicly available
[bomb defusal manual](http://www.bombmanual.com/).
